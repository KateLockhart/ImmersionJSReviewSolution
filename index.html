        In Foundations we discussed referencing tags in the HTML to add our elements made in our JavaScript File. 

        The tags we will be using today are HTML5's Semantic Elements. Meaning the element name describes what it is to both the browser rendering it and the developer creating it. They clearly define their content, but most importantly improve the website's accessibility.  

        Be sure to check out some online resources for more depth on how each tag functions if you're curious! (You can even house the links to your favorite online resources in this comment or your notes.)
