## JavaScript Coding Foundations Material Review

To get a refresher on our early HTML and JavaScript concepts from Coding Foundations, follow through the file comments for code directions starting with the index.html before working in the index.js. Just like how JavaScript reads the index.js file contents from top to bottom, working from the top down will make the most sense.

If you feel stuck, be sure to review your Coding Foundations notes, refer to your Immersion JS modules, look up concepts online, and (most of all) reach out to your peers for assistance!
